## Purpose and objectives

### Introduction

The app should help to organize organize local paper (books, documents and etc.) storage using the graph based database storage. 
The main goal is to provide easy access and navigation throw database and add horisontal connections throw papers (nodes). 

### Target user base
- Main target group is researchers and student who need to build and use large amount of papers, books, notes and etc.
- Researchers and students often create local paper databases to maintain independence from web access or journal subscriptions, which are typically available exclusively through their institute's network.
- Often such local databases are messy

### App Objectives
- Allow user to build a database providing keywords to connect nodes (papers and etc.) between each other. 
- Improving document organization
- Accelerating navigation throw the database
- Easy database sharing

### Key Features
- Add document to the database by url, doi or local file path
- Add keywords from the list or create new one for the specific node
- Show all connected keywords and documents to the specific document
- Cross-platform compability
- Save whole database as one file
- Combine few databases in one

### Expected benefits
- Reduced time spent searching for documents
- Enhanced understanding of relationships between papers

### Success Criteria
- Real user satisfaction
